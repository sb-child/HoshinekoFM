# Hoshineko File Manager

Hoshineko File Manager is a modern, "Performance-First" file manager built using Material 3 Design, Electron, and React.
The Hoshineko file explorer is a modification and reconstruction of bhimio1's material-3-file-explorer project. This project was initiated because the original repository is no longer actively maintained, and we aimed to develop a file manager fully compliant with Material 3 Design standards.

## Features

- **Material Design 3 Interface**: sleek, modern UI with dynamic theming.
- **Performance First**: Reconfigured file list processing mechanism utilizing technologies such as virtualized lists.
- **Tabs**: Tabbed navigation support.
- **Omnibar**: Unified search and address bar, compatible with fd and standard shell commands.
- **Built-in Terminal Emulator**: Built-in terminal emulator support.
- **Preview Support**: Quick look for common file types.

## Refactoring and modification of core functionalities from material-3-file-explorer project
- **Free for Multi Selection**: Features multi-selection capabilities, with optimized drag-and-drop transmission for applications such as LocalSend.
- **Better File Categorization**:Refactored file categorization mechanism to support a wider range of file types; includes icon display for specific device types within the /dev directory (this feature is currently under active development).
- **Convenient and Smart Right-Click Menu**:Refactored the context menu architecture to dynamically display specific menu items based on the selected item type, while extending menu features; the menu design is optimized for long-press gestures on touchscreen devices.
- **The rest includes a massive amount of refactoring and completion relative to the material-3-file-explorer project, equipping it with the characteristics of a modern file manager.**

## Custom Theming (Matugen)

Materials supports dynamic theming via [Matugen](https://github.com/InioX/matugen).

To use your system colors:
1. Install Matugen.
2. Generate a theme file at `~/.config/matugen/theme.css`.
3. The app will automatically detect and apply this theme on startup.

Example command to generate theme from wallpaper:
```bash
matugen image /path/to/wallpaper.jpg --type css --output ~/.config/matugen/theme.css
```
